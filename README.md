# Rock Paper Scissors AI Game

In this Rock, Paper, Scissors project, an array tracked the user's move frequency to help the AI predict and counter the next move. 
Integers managed the seed, rounds, moves, and win counts, while a string stored the user's name. The AI used this data to increase its chances of winning.

The user enters their move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) for each round, while the AI predicts the user's next move based on the frequency of their past moves. 
The AI tracks the user's move frequencies and uses this data to make informed predictions about the user's likely next move.

Based on its prediction, the AI selects a counter move designed to beat the predicted user move. For example, if the AI predicts that the user will choose Rock, it will choose Paper to win the round. 
This decision-making process helps the AI adapt to the user's play patterns and increase its chances of winning.

After each round, the program compares the user's move with the AI's move to determine the winner. 
It keeps track of the number of wins for both the user and the AI. At the end of the game, the program displays the total number of wins for each player, providing a summary of the game's outcome.
